</h3><br>
         <p style=" text-align: justify;">Project based learning provides a platform to the child to showcase his/her latent talents and inventiveness. Projects in 'Math' and 'Science' ensure long term learning and clarification of  concepts. It also gives an opportunity to the passive learners and makes learning fun. <br><br> Children are required to work on projects from the very beginning of their schooling. The topics are diverse and the complexity level changes as the children grow up.

         <p style=" text-align: justify;">The teacher is today a “knowledge facilitator” rather than a "knowledge provider". This is possible with the help of videos & other technological means. Chanakya  campus is Wi-Fi enabled; the wireless network connects all computers with the internet through a leased line. <br><br> Teachers and students have access to research based learning anytime, anywhere. The learning atmosphere created in Chanakya  is a sum total, delivering core concepts through the best possible technology. This not only enables effective learning, but also creates technical skills in students at a very young age.

</h3><br>
         <p style=" text-align: justify;">
We understand that different individuals have different aptitudes. Our faculty utilises the Multiple Intelligence Theory of Dr. Howard Gardner to make its teaching more effective and clear. We understand that every child can be benefitted by the implementation of some or the other intelligence. <br><br> By using the strongest aptitudes or 'intelligences' as a starting point, our educators educate more effectively by teaching different students the same topic in different ways, according to their particular 'intelligences'. Through this, each student is given an opportunity to come at par with what is required. Special classes for weaker students, and helping those who need special attention, in one or the other subject, leads to an overall, broad and complete educational experience by the child.

</h3><br>
         <p style=" text-align: justify;">The School Cinema Programme teach life skills through an extremely innovative and entertaining medium of movies and role plays.
Life skills training is an efficacious tool for empowering the youth to act responsibly, take initiative and take control of their lives. Life skills include psychosocial competencies and inter personal skills that help children make decisions, solve problems, think deeply, communicate effectively, build healthy relationships, empathy  with others and cope with managing their lives in a healthy and productive manner. <br><br> We use methods like class discussions, story telling, brainstorming, role plays, audio-visual activities etc  encouraging young people to learn from their environment by observing how others behave and what consequences arise from their behavior. Thus, teaching outside the classroom becomes as important as that within the walls. <br><br> Excursions, field trips and visits to various organizations like old age home, blind school etc. are conducted for this purpose. Learning, thus, becomes not only a fun filled activity, but also enriching one.
