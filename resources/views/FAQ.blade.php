<div class="abt-title">
<h3>What is difference between GCSE &amp;IGCSE?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>GCSE and IGCSE are qualifications which are at the same level. The IGCSE has been
developed to be more relevant to students learning in an ‘international’ or non-UK
context. The “I” stands for international. These qualifications have become so popular
that a number of independent schools in the UK are now moving away from the GCSE
and adopting the IGCSE. However, in terms of entrance into post-secondary and other
courses, the qualifications are seen as equivalent.</p>

</div>

<br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3>What are the prerequisites for taking an IGCSE subject?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>There are none. You don’t need to be a native English user, as long as your English
language skills are sufficient for learning the course</p>
</div>


<br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3>What is the difference between Edexcel and CIE I/GCSE’s?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>There is no difference in the level or degree of difficulty between the IGCSEs offered by
Edexcel and CIE. The differences are only in the way questions are asked and the format
of the exams.</p>

</div>



<br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3>Where is IGCSE accepted &amp; recognized?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>The IGCSE is an internationally recognized qualification. You can use it to enroll in IT’S
A-level courses both live and video.</p>

</div>


<br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3>Is there coursework in IGCSE?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>This depends. While schools do have a coursework option in some subjects, it is also
possible to complete IGCSEs 100% by written examination.</p>

</div>



<br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3>How Many times per year are the exams offered?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>IGCSE exams are offered twice a year. Edexcel in January and in May/June and CIE in
November and June.</p>

</div>
					</div>

					<div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-profile" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-profile-tab">
					<div class="abt-title">
<h3>What is EDEXCEL?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>Edexcel, a Pearson company, is the UK&#39;s largest awarding body offering academic and
vocational qualifications and testing to schools, colleges, employers and other places of
learning in the UK and internationally.</p>
<p>Edexcel was formed in 1996 by the merger of the Business &amp; Technology Education
Council (BTEC), the UK’s leading provider of vocational qualifications, and the
University of London Examinations &amp; Assessment Council (ULEAC), one of the major
exam boards for GCSEs and A-levels.</p>

</div>



<br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3>What is difference between Edexcel International Examinations &amp;
Cambridge?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>Edexcel and CIE are both examples of UK exam boards. They both provide a range of
internationally recognized qualifications. The boards are 100% equivalent. It makes no
difference which version you take.</p>

</div>



<br><br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3 style="text-align: center;">UK GCE, AS/A2, International A-levels</h3>
<h3>What is the difference between GCE A-level and International A-level?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>he GCE A-level is a linear qualification taken over two years by students at school in the
UK. International students can still take it but they should note they will take regional
versions and will sit papers at slightly different times. The examinations take place in
June. GCE A-levels carry UCAS tariff points.</p>

<p>The International A-level is especially for students studying outside of the UK. It follows
a modular structure so you can build the qualification over time. Examinations take
place in January, June and October. International A-levels can be used to access
university courses.</p>
</div>



<br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3>Do I have to an IGCSE in a subject before taking the GCE/International A-
level in that subject?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>No. However IGCSEs do provide a good foundation. You may wish to study
IGCSE material informally before moving on to GCE/International A-level.</p>

</div>




<br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3>What do A-level, AS and A2 mean?</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
<p>In GCE A-level one examination takes place at the end of the course. There
are GCE AS-levels which count as &quot;half&quot; an A-level. University places are
awarded on the basis of grades at A-level but AS awards also attract UCAS
points and are often counted towards university entrance.</p>

<p>A2 refers to the final stage of International A-levels. Students who have
successfully completed AS units in a subject move on to do A2 units, which
are of a higher standard. Completing the correct sequence of units at both
AS and A2 level means you have finished a full International A-level in a
subject. University entrance is at the discretion of the university based on
your AS and A2 grades.</p>

six separate subjects where you have some choice over what you
study.</p>
</div>



<br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3>Compulsory core</h3>

</div>
<div class="about-desc">
	<p>The compulsory core contains three elements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>theory of knowledge: you&#39;ll learn about the bases of knowledge,
and how to analyse evidence and express yourself in rational
argument; you&#39;ll also be encouraged to draw on experiences
you&#39;ve gained outside the classroom</li>
<li>creativity, action and service: this part of the programme
encourages you to get involved in theatre or music activities,
sports and/or community service</li>
<li>extended essay: you&#39;ll investigate a particular topic of interest
and be asked to write a 4,000 word essay about it</li>
</ul>
</div>


<br><br>
<div class="abt-title">
<h3>Optional subjects</h3>
</div>
<div class="about-desc">
	<p>As well as the three core elements, you&#39;ll also select one subject from
each of the following six areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>first language (normally your mother tongue).</li>
<li>second language (this could be a language you already study,
or a new one).</li>
<li>experimental sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, design
technology).</li>
<li>mathematics and computer science.</li>
<li>the arts (visual, music and theatre).</li>
<li>individuals and society (history, psychology, geography). </li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, you&#39;ll study three of your six optional subjects at a &#39; higher&#39;
level (240 teaching hours per subject), and the other three at a
&#39;standard&#39; level (150 teaching hours). However, you can also opt to
take four subjects at the higher level and two at the standard level.</p>


<br>
<p><b>How you are assessed</b></p>
<p>Most of the assessment is done through exams, marked externally.
However, in nearly all subjects, some of the assessment is carried out
by your teachers, who mark individual pieces of coursework. – the IAs
or Internal Assessments.</p>
<p>The Diploma normally takes two years to complete, with exams
taking place in May and November.</p>
</div>




<br><br>

maximum of 45:</p>
